I went through several bootcamps on Boot.dev which was made by some of my favorite developers that I learned a lot from on YouTube:

	1. Object Oriented Programming 
	2. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
	3. Learn Functional Programming in Python
	4. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms in Python 2
