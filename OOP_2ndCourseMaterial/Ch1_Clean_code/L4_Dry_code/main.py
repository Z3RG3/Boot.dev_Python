!DRY Code
*Another "rule of thumb" for writing maintainable code is "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY). It means that, when possible, you should avoid writing the same code in multiple places. Repeating code can be bad because:

If you need to change it, you have to change it in multiple places
If you forget to change it in one place, you'll have a bug
It's more work to write it over and over again
?Assignment
Your manager noticed that "Age of Dragons" has a lot of repetitive code. She's asked you to update the fight_soldiers function so that the DPS (damage-per-second) calculation is only written once.

Notice how these two lines are practically identical:

soldier_one_dps = soldier_one["damage"] * soldier_one["attacks_per_second"]
soldier_two_dps = soldier_two["damage"] * soldier_two["attacks_per_second"]

Create a new function called get_soldier_dps that takes a soldier and returns its DPS using the same logic as the lines above.
Replace the two lines above with calls to get_soldier_dps.
The soldier with the greater DPS will win the fight!

def fight_soldiers(soldier_one, soldier_two):
    soldier_one_dps = get_soldier_dps(soldier_one)
    soldier_two_dps = get_soldier_dps(soldier_two)
    if soldier_one_dps > soldier_two_dps:
        return "soldier 1 wins"
    if soldier_two_dps > soldier_one_dps:
        return "soldier 2 wins"
    return "both soldiers die"


def get_soldier_dps(soldier):
    return soldier["damage"] * soldier["attacks_per_second"]
